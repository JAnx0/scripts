# mount-vmware-shared-folders

Mounting shared folders to VMWare made easy!
This is a very simple script to directly mount shared folders from Host to VMWare Linux VM's.

## Pre-Requisits

* Installed vmware-tools!

## Usage

```bash
chmod +x mount_vmware_shared_folders.sh
sudo ./mount_vmware_shared_folders.sh
```

## Tested on:

* VMWare Workstation Player >= 15
* Kali Linux >= 2021.3
* Debian >= 10 
* Ubuntu >= 20.04
* Hence, it should work for all Debian based distros for sure, for others as well I guess

Have fun!
